# Purpose of site

Given **COVID-19 is Airborne** and the world is pushing to better ventilate schools for long term student and teacher health, we're tracking the progress for that in Ireland. This is ahead of government effort to do the same. If government starts to track this work, this effort will continue because that effort might be weak.We're guided by 33 profs and PhDs who are pushing for a policy change in a March 2024 article on **Science.org**: [Mandating indoor air quality for public buildings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16l_IH47cQtC7fFuafvHca7ORNVGITxx8/view). Not only active ventilation (which should be mechanical heat recovery type in this age), but air filtration/purification too and CO2 monitoring to drive ventilation levels, as CO2 inside is a proxy indicator for COVID risk. As it happens the WHO also have a [2023 airborne risk assessment guide](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/376346)

Know that other diseases are airborne too: Measles (studies [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2810934/pdf/10982072.pdf) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880795/pdf/nihms532643.pdf) [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31257413/) [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655316305363)), Influenza, RSV and TB. The same ventilation and air filtration measures reduce transmission of those too.

 When we say student and teacher health, we're wanting absences to go down too. If we lower transmission in schools, we reduce multi-generation transmission too, as kids bring infections home to parents. With lowered transmission, we also reduce long COVID, where the worst sufferers have disappeared from education and the workplace.

# Official Republic of Ireland School Ventilation Policy

Schools should follow the guidelines provided by the Department of Education, which emphasize the importance of good ventilation to reduce the risk of airborne virus transmission. 

Published in 2021, [Guidance on Ventilation in Schools](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/) and still online in 2024. The linked PDFs are a solid discussion of ventilation, air filtration/cleaning and CO2 monitor as a proxy risk indicator. For Ireland in the summer months opening windows provides some benefit. This isn't likely to happen in the winter, or if the school as adjacent to a very busy road (diesel fumes).

A prior government page See <https://www.education.ie/en/Covid-19/> was taken down in 2021, but [an archived version can be seen here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210109215847/https://www.education.ie/en/Covid-19/). Note: the page never talked of ventilation, air-filtration, etc.
